# Apriori-Algorithm
Description:
•	Consider the sets of transactions for a coffee shop in the attached file "CoffeeShopTransactions.xlsx".
o	The file contains transactions of items for a coffeeshop.
o	Each row represents a transaction at a specific time.
o	Each transaction contains a set of items defined with their names.
o	Each item is in a separate column.
Requirements:
•	Write a program in any programming language that implements one of the association algorithms (Apriori, FP-Growth or vertical data format) on this set of transactions. 
•	Minimum support & minimum confidence should be variable as per user input during runtime.
•	Then generate all association rules which can be mined from the transactions.
•	The final output of your program should show the frequent item sets and association rules with their confidence.
